# IT-PAT-2019
Grade 12 final IT project

This is my PAT (Practical assessment task) for Information Technology in my finnal year of high school.
My school is Glenwood House in George, following the IEB guideline for private schooling. I received a 96%, as far as I know this
is the highest mark in my class.

The application I developed is to be used by blood donors and the nurses that process their applications. Although it will never be
used in the real world, as a regular blood donor I enjoyed making this. 
The GUI may not look great, but I spent the majority of my time debugging and handed in late.

The purpose of sharing this project is to provide a resource for any students working on their PATs.
